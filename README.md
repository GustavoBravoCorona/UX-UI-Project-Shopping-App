# UX-UI-Project-Shopping-App

This project is a UX/UI design prototype for a mobile shopping app that allows users to browse, select, and purchase clothing easily and efficiently. The goal of the project was to create a visually appealing, user-friendly experience that simplifies online clothes shopping while maintaining a modern and clean design.

Users can explore clothing categories, view detailed product pages with images, prices, and descriptions, and add items to their cart with minimal effort. I also focused on usability, accessibility, and consistency across screens to ensure a seamless user experience.
